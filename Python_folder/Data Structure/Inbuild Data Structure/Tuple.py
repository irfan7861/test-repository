# Tuple
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#
# Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and
# Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
#
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
#
# Tuples are written with round brackets.



# tuple1 = (1,2,3)
# print(tuple1)
#
# tuple1 = tuple1 + (4,5,6)
# print(tuple1)

#Indexing

# tuple1 = (1,2,3,"irfan")
# print(tuple1[3])


# Tuple Items
# Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
#
# Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
#
# Ordered
# When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
#
# Unchangeable
# Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
#
# Allow Duplicates
# Since tuple are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value:

this = ("irfan", "sameer", 1,25,67,"irfan")
print(this)
print(len(this))

# String, int and boolean data types:
a = ("sameer","banana", "shahir")
b = (1234,878,978,99)
c = (None,False)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
