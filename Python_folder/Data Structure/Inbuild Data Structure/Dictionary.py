# Dictionary
# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
#
# A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates.
#
# Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

# Unordered
# When we say that dictionaries are unordered, it means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to
# an item by using an index.
#
# Changeable
# Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
#
# Duplicates Not Allowed
# Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:

# z = {"irfan" :"burger",
#      "shahir" : "pizza",
#      "gourav" : "momos"}
#
# print(len(z))


# String, int, boolean, and list data types:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]}
