# types of operators
# arithmetic operator
# assihnment operator
# comparison operator
# logical operator
# identically operator
# membership operator
# bitwise operator

#arithmetic operator
a=7
b=8
print(a+b)
print(a*b)
print(a-b)
print(a/b)
print(a//b)
print(a**b)
print(a%b)

#assignment oprators
x=7
print(x)
x +=7   # x = x+7
print(x)

# comparison oprators
x=8
print(x==8)
print(x!=8)
print(x>=8)

#logical operators
a= True   # 1
b= False    #0
print(a and b)  #1*0 = 0
print(a and a)
print(a or b)   # 1 + 0 =1
print(a is not b) #!=

#Membership operators
list = [34,23,23,12,35,67]

str = "abcdef"
print('r' in str)
print(34 in list)
print(342 in list)

# bitwise operators

#dictionary
